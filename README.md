# CreaS: Decentralized Creator Revenue Sharing Platform

## Overview
CreaS is a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain that enables transparent revenue sharing and licensing management for creative collaborations. Using smart contracts, it automates revenue distribution among collaborators while maintaining a transparent record of all transactions and usage rights.

## Features
- Automated revenue splitting between collaborators
- Transparent royalty distribution system
- Built-in licensing and usage tracking
- Real-time earnings monitoring
- Customizable revenue share percentages
- Permanent record of collaboration terms

## Technical Architecture
The platform consists of three main components:
1. Smart Contract (Clarity)
2. Frontend Interface (React/Next.js recommended)
3. IPFS Integration for Content Storage

### Smart Contract Structure
- Project Management
- Collaborator Management
- Revenue Distribution
- Licensing Management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet (Hiro Wallet recommended)
- Clarity CLI
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CreaS
cd CreaS
```

2. Deploy the smart contract
```bash
clarinet contract deploy
```
```

## Usage

### Creating a Project
```clarity
(contract-call? .creative-share create-project 
    u1 
    "My Creative Project" 
    0x... ;; Content hash
    "Standard License"
)
```

### Adding Collaborators
```clarity
(contract-call? .creative-share add-collaborator 
    u1 
    'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 
    u30 
    "Artist"
)
```

### Recording License Usage
```clarity
(contract-call? .creative-share record-license-usage 
    u1 
    "Commercial Use" 
    u1000
)
```

## Security Considerations
- Multi-signature requirements for major project changes
- Secure revenue distribution mechanism
- Protected licensing information
- Access control for project management

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with NFT marketplaces
2. Advanced licensing templates
3. Dispute resolution mechanism
4. Cross-chain compatibility
5. Enhanced analytics dashboard
